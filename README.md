# softKracker







SoftKracker is a highly configurable and dangerous virus script designed to wreak havoc on unsuspecting systems. Upon execution, the script presents users with a warning message, alerting them to the potential consequences of running the program. However, users are given the option to proceed, with the script's inherent danger concealed behind a facade of user choice.

Once initiated, SoftKracker begins its malicious operations with ruthless efficiency. The script leverages a combination of advanced techniques and system-level commands to carry out its destructive agenda.

The primary function of SoftKracker is to obliterate all files and directories on the infected computer. Using the os and shutil modules in Python, the script systematically traverses the file system, annihilating every trace of data in its path. This indiscriminate destruction leaves victims with no recourse, as their digital assets are erased without mercy.

But SoftKracker's reach extends beyond individual systems. With its network scanning capabilities, the script seeks out other vulnerable computers on the network, intent on spreading its contagion far and wide. By employing tools like nmap, SoftKracker identifies potential targets and initiates the infection process, perpetuating its reign of chaos with every new victim.
